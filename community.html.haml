        %h3 Post questions

        %p We use <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/netty">StackOverflow</a> as the place to ask the questions. Just tag your question with '<strong>netty</strong>', and then we will respond.

        %h3 Stay tuned &amp; spread the words

        %p Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/netty_project">@netty_project</a> at Twitter, mention us, and use the '<a href="#{site.twitter_search_url}"><strong>#Netty</strong></a>' hashÂ­tag. Subscribe to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/netty_project">our RSS feed</a> to get useful information. If you are interested in how we work with code, watch <a href="https://github.com/netty/netty">our Github repository</a>.

        %p Even better, if you are in the mood of writing something longer, think about writing <a href="../wiki/related-articles.html">an article about Netty</a> and let us know.

        %p Found a bug? Browse <a href="https://github.com/netty/netty/issues">our issue tracker</a> and file an issue if it was not reported before. Get back and let us know if it's fixed.

        %p If you think the bug you found is likely to make Netty-based applications vulnerable to an attack, please do not use our public issue tracker but report it to <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/netty-security">the dedicated private Google Group</a>.
