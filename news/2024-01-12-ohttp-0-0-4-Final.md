We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-ohttp 0.0.4.Final. This release contains various bugfixes and performance improvements over the previous releases. Beside this it also contains a native implementation for HPKE that uses BoringSSL.

The release also contains various breaking changes which were required to enable various improvements.

The most important changes are:

* Move enums out of OHttpCryptoProvider ([#27](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/27))
* Replace OHttpCryptoProvider.supported* methods with isSupported(...) ([#29](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/29))
* Close HPKERecipientContext when OHttpCryptoReceiver.Builder.build() throws ([#34](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/34))
* Replace OHttpCryptoReceiver.Builder.setServerKeys(...) with OHttpCryptoReceiver.Builder.setSenderPrivateKey(...) ([#35](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/35))
* Remove import of bouncycastle from OHttpCiphersuite ([#37](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/37))
* Add OHttpCryptoProvider.newRandomPrivateKey(...) ([#30](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/30))
* Remove HPKEMode enum as we always use Base anyway. ([#32](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/32))
* Allow *CryptoContext to give a hint which type of buffer is preferred ([#42](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/42))
