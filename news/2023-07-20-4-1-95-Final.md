We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.95.Final. This is mainly a bug-fix release but also add a few small features.

The most important changes are:

* Add resource leak listener ([#13466](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13466)) 
* Reduce object allocations during SslHandler.flush(...) ([#13472](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13472)) 
* Ensure ByteBuf.capacity(...) will never throw AssertionError ([#13478](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13478))
* Make transport.Bootstrap usable with no netty-resolver on classpath ([#13488](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13488))
* Correctly retain slice when calling ReplayingDecoderByteBuf.retainedSlice(...) ([#13496](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13496))
* Always increment Stream Id on createStream(...) ([#13485](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13485))
* Fix BrotliEncoder bug that does not mark ByteBuf it encodes as read ([#13497](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13497))
* Enhance CertificateException message when throw due hostname validation ([#13381](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13381))
