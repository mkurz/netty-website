We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.39.Final. This release is mostly a bug-fix release but also add the possibility to inspect details about why the remote peer closed the connection.


The most important changes are:

* Upgrade to quiche version that fixes final_size for RESET_STREAM ([#491](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/491))
* Update to latest quiche version which added support for key updates ([#497](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/497))
* Add QuicConnectionCloseEvent to be able to inspect why the remote peer closed the connection ([#314](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/314))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/milestone/37?closed=1).
