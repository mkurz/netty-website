We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.91.Final.
This is a bug-fix release, which contains an important fix for our native SSL implementation that fixes a problem that could lead to problems in your state-machines. See [#13314](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13314).

The most important changes are:

* Fire a PrematureChannelClosureException when Channel is closed while aggregating is still in progress ([#13290](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13290)) 
* Connect without password if server returns NO_AUTH when using Socks5 ([#13290](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13290)) 
* Use optional resolution of sun.net.dns ([#13303](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13303)) 
* Introduce Http2MultiplexActiveStreamsException that can be used to propagate an error to all active streams ([#13306](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13306)) 
* Use the correct error when reset a stream ([#13309](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13309)) 
* Update: Add snappy support on HttpContentDecoder ([#13312](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13312))
* Don't unwrap multiple records until we notified the caller about the finished handshake ([#13314](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13314))
* Handle EHOSTUNREACH errors in io.netty.channel.unix.Errors  ([#13317](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13317))
