We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.57.Final. 
This release is a bug fix release which fixes an issue which could lead to high memory usage due missing cleanup of closed connections in some cases.

The most important changes are:

* Update to quiche 0.3.0 ([#651](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/651))
* Reduce memory usage of QuicheQuicChannel ([#653](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/653))
* Correctly fail connect future if failure in parent pipeline accours ([#657](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/657))
* Ensure QuicheQuicChannel is always removed from the QuicheQuicChannel ([#660](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/660))
* Reduce native memory usage of QuicheQuicConnection ([#661](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/661))
* Ensure we correctly detect closure if ssl tasks are offloaded. ([#663](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/663))
* Don't cache local and remote address as these might change during the lifetime ([#664](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/664))
* Correctly handle lifetimes and channel state ([#665](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/665))
