We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.99.Final. This release fixes a bug which could lead to SIGSERV while running on JDK21+. As JDK21 was recently released and is considered an LTS release we did decided to do this emergency release. Because of the nature of this bug (crashing the JVM) you should upgrade ASAP. 

The most important changes are:

* Do not try to delete a global handle with the local handles APIs ([#13640](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13640)) 
* Enable build with JDK21 ([#13614](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13627)) 
* dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _netty_jni_util_JNI_OnLoad ([#13632](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13632))
