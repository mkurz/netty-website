We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.46.Final. This release fixes a native memory leak and so we encourage everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.


The most important changes are:

* Ensure private key and cert chain are always destroyed even when the result is not used ([#530](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/530))
* Add missing ReleaseByteArrayElements to fix memory leak ([#534](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/534))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.0.46.Final).
