We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.94.Final. This is mainly a bug-fix release but also contains a fix for a possible security issue ([CVE-2023-34462](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-6mjq-h674-j845)) when using SniHandler.

The most important changes are:

* Respect offset in io.netty.util.NetUtil#toAddressString(byte[], int, boolean) ([#13420](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13420)) 
* Skip finalization for PoolThreadCache instances without small/normal caches ([#13408](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13408))
* Use network byte order when encoding ipv4 address and port for Socks codecs ([#13427](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13427))
* Call ReleaseByteArrayElements even when handling of socket_path fails to fix small mem leak ([#13435](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13435))
* Always enable leak tracking for derived buffers if parent is tracked ([#13436](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13436))
* Release DnsRecords when failing to notify promise ([#13437](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13437)) 
* Delay possibility to reuse transaction id when query is failing because of timeout or cancellation ([#13446](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13446)) 
* Implement contains for SelectedSelectionKeySet ([#13452](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13452)) 
* Use Two-Way for finding the delimiter in DelimiterBasedFrameDecoder ([#13451](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13451)) 
* Obtain the local address from the fd when the client connects only with remote address (UDS) ([#13419](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13419))
* Allow to limit the maximum lenght of the ClientHello ([CVE-2023-34462](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-6mjq-h674-j845))
