We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.106.Final. We decided to do a fast followup release to 4.1.105.Final as someone just
discoverd a [HTTP2 bug (#13786)](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13786) which might lead to corruptions when a lot of headers are send.
This bug existed since a very long time but was only discovered this week.


The most important changes are:

* HTTP2: Prevent sharing the index of the continuation frame header ByteBuf. ([#13786](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13786))
* DnsNameResolver: Fail query if id space is exhausted ([#13784](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13784))
* Short-circuit ByteBuf::release ([#13782](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/13782))
