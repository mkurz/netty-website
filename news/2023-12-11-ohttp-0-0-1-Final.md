We are happy to announce the first release of netty-incubator-codec-ohttp a.k.a 0.0.1.Final. This release also contains an implementation of [Binary HTTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9292.html) as Binary HTTP is used by [Oblivious HTTP](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-ohai-ohttp-10.html).

The most important changes are:

* Initial commit of OHTTP implementation for netty ([df8d7f8b78c2c49c0f0e9886abbb2517ff568300](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/commit/df8d7f8b78c2c49c0f0e9886abbb2517ff568300))
* Make it easier to support custom OHttpVersion implementations ([#2](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/2))
* Simplify API for users and also simplify internal usage ([#4](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/4))
