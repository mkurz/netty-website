We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.53.Final. This release is mostly a bug-fix release.
But also contains one breaking change which you might encounter.


The most important changes are:

* Correctly handle the case when write happens after close ([#611](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/611))
* Remove QuicConnectEvent ([#618](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/618))
* Remove QuicStreamChannel.WRITE_FIN ([#620](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/620))
* Support connection migration on the server-side ([#615](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/615))
* Propagate events for path related activities ([#623](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/623))
* POnly close channel when receiving a STOP_SENDING frame ([#626](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/626))

# Breaking change

The `QuicConnectEvent` was removed in favor of different `QuicPathEvent` subtypes. If you use `QuicConnectEvent` in your code you will need to replace it by the correct sub-class of `QuicPathEvent`.
