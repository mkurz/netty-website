We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.59.Final. This release includes the new `QuicCodecDispatcher` which should be used when `SO_REUSEPORT` is used. This `ChannelHandler` does quarantee the routing / dispatching of QUIC packets to the correct `codec`.

For more details on how to use `QuicCodecDispatcher` please have a look at our [QuicServerSoReusePortExample](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/blob/netty-incubator-codec-parent-quic-0.0.59.Final/codec-native-quic/src/test/java/io/netty/incubator/codec/quic/example/QuicServerSoReusePortExample.java). An alrernative way how to handle this would be to implement your own `ebpf` programm that ensures the correct dispatching. See the javadocs of `QuicCodecDispatcher` for more details.


The most important changes are:

* Fix exception message for exceptions caused by receiving a STOP_SENDING frame ([#684](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/684))
* Add QuicTimeoutClosedChannelException which will be used to fail writes for streams when the Channel was closed because of a idle timeout ([#685](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/685))
* Add QuicCodecDispatcher that should be used when SO_REUSEPORT is used ([#687](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/687))
* Only try to find index for QUIC packets with short header format ([#692](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/692))
