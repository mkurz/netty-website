We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.56.Final. 
This release is a bug fix release.

The most important changes are:

* Update to latest quiche code ([#647](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/647))
* Fire SniCompletionEvent as soon as the SNI hostname was selected([#644](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/644))
* Ensure we also set the QuicConnectionId when the id has a length of 0. ([#649](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/649))
* Copy a missing field in QuicServerCodecBuilder's copy constructor ([#641](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/641))
