We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.61.Final. This release fixes an issue which can result in re-ordered writes, please upgrade as soon as possible!

The most important changes are:

* Ensure writes are done in the correct order even when we already have some writes queued ([#699](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/699))
* Add ability to get path stats ([#680](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/680))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/issues?q=milestone%3A0.0.61.Final+is%3Aclosed).
