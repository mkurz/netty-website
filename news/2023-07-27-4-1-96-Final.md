We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.96.Final. This releases fixes a performance regression introduced in 4.1.95.Final and a small regression in HTTP/2. 
Because of that we urge everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.

The most important changes are:

* Move the PoolThreadCache finalizer to a separate object ([#13510](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13510)) 
* Fix kevent(..) failed: Invalid argument ([#13503](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13503)) 
* Revert "Always increment Stream Id on createStream (#13485)" to fix bâ€¦ug which caused sending multiple RST frames for the same id ([1735b4230a4935cbecedb48fd687c67aba950068](https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/013c38298f6d28ec14543d02ede9bb6a6472ca3f))
