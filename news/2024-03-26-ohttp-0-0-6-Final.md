We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-ohttp 0.0.6.Final. This release is a bug-fix release.


The most important changes are:

* OHttpServerCodec should drop content if no OHttpVersion can be selected ([#48](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/48))
* Bump io.netty:netty-codec-http from 4.1.107.Final to 4.1.108.Final ([#54](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/54))
Check if receiver was created before trying to close it when destroying the context ([#55](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/55))


For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/milestone/6?closed=1).
