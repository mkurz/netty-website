We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-ohttp 0.0.5.Final. This release provides some performance improvements when using the native HPKE implementation and one API breaking change.

The most important changes are:

* Rename method to be less missleading ([#44](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/44))
* Reuse EVP_HPKE_KEY when using BoringSSLOHttpCryptoProvider.setupHPKEBaseR ([#23](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/pull/23))


For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-ohttp/milestone/5?closed=1).
