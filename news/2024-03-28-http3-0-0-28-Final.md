We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-http3 0.0.28.Final. This release update its netty-incubator-codec-quic version to 0.0.62.Final, which fixes a bug that could cause re-ordering of writes.
Because of this we urge everyone to upgrade as soon as possible. 

The most important changes are:

* Bump io.netty:netty-codec-http from 4.1.107.Final to 4.1.108.Final ([#294](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-http3/issues/294))
* Upgrade to netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.62.Final to fix re-ordering issues ([#295](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-http3/issues/295))


For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-http3/milestone/26?closed=1).
