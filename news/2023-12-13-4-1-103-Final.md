We are happy to announce the release of netty 4.1.103.Final. This is (mostly) a bug-fix release, but also contains a change which helps to workaround a bug in grpc-java < 1.59.1 that can cause problems when upgrade netty when also using grpc-java.


The most important changes are:

* Workaround for regex bug in Android SDK ([#13695](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13695)) 
* Use Http2Headers.size() instead of isEmpty() ([#13717](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13717)) 
* Add support for RISC-V ([#13770](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/13770))
