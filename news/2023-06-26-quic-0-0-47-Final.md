We are happy to announce the release of netty-incubator-codec-quic 0.0.47.Final. This release fixes a possible buffer leak when using the native epoll transport and so we encourage everyone to upgrade as soon as possible.


The most important changes are:

* Don't leak ByteBuf when sending segments will use the whole send quantum ([#540](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/540))
* Remove dependency on commons-codec ([#543](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/pull/543))

For more details related to this release see our [bug-tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty-incubator-codec-quic/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A0.0.47.Final).
